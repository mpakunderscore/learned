Goal: continuous learning process. I builded knowledge graph system based on incoming links. And a recommendation system based on it. To maintain the process of education I have to add non artificial agents to interact with users. I have to build different style chatbots to maintain the motivation process. Some engines with a user state of education process and text generation for non artificial feel.
